  "statement": "I enjoy painting realistic portrayals of the human form and mixing that with abstracted landscapes inspired by the highland environment I grew up in.\n\nUsing scale, contrast and composition, I create atmospheric worlds in which the subjects of the paintings inhabit. Striking, slightly unsettling, jagged, unworldly backdrops that accentuate the fragility of the human condition represented by the figures. My paintings are inspired by my own life experiences."
