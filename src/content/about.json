  "statement": "I enjoy painting realistic portrayals of the human form and mixing that with abstracted landscapes inspired by the highland environment I grew up in.\n\nUsing scale, contrast and composition, I create atmospheric worlds in which the subjects of the paintings inhabit. Striking, jagged backdrops that accentuate the fragility of the human condition represented by the figures."
